#Genie's Lamp

A Chrome extension that puts genie's lamp on any page you're on.
Basically, the extension searches the page for links and buttons
and makes each of those a wish (lets you "click" those using the
keyboard). For example, if I had a link on the page like this:

`<a href="www.google.com">Google Home Page</a>`

Then I could type `ctrl + space`, type "Goo" and that link would
show up as a wish. Then I'd hit `enter` and I would be taken to
`www.google.com`.

#Features

Typing an apostrophe (') will show all the available wishes.

This will do simple math. Type `1 + 1` and genies lamp will show you the answer.
You can  also do some simple functions, like `sin(34)`.

Genie's lamp does its best to know what icon to associate with a wish.
It doesn't always pick up the icon and if it does sometimes it is not perfect
and sometimes the styling can be funny. This is due to a limitation of trying
to be as generic as possible. Please let me know of any issues you find and
I'll see if I can get them worked out.
