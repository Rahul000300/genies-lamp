#Genie's Lamp

A Chrome extension that puts genie's lamp on any page you're on.
Basically, the extension searches the page for links and buttons
and makes each of those a wish (lets you "click" those using the
keyboard). For example, if I had a link on the page like this:

`<a href="www.google.com">Google Home Page</a>`

Then I could type `ctrl + space`, type "Goo" and that link would
show up as a wish. Then I'd hit `enter` and I would be taken to
`www.google.com`.

#Features

Typing an apostrophe (') will show all the available wishes.
